This is task1-ICMP Ping
@For the basic functions: The ping function can be realized correctlyï¼Œ and can measure delay time and report packet loss.
@For the additional functions:
1. The program can take an IP or host name as an argument.
2. Once the ping stopped, the programe can show minimum, average and maximum delay across all measurements.
3. The program has a configurable timeout, which can be entered by uesers.
4. It can measure and report packet loss.
5. The program has a configurable measurement count
5. The program can handle the icmp error types. 
@NOTE:
This programe has a User interface, which is developed under Python 3.7
The program can output on both GUI and terminal (with print).
The comments are localed in the upper side of each line.
